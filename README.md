 # Assignment: CATALOG OF ARCHIVAL RESILIENCE [IMD+CODING]

**A primary function of the archive involves securing the long-term preservation of artefacts and documents. But as contemporary cultural practices increasingly take place online (within and through immaterial digital formats), new strategies of resilience are needed to ensure long-term preservation and access of digital heritage. Challenges — such as technological obsolescence and linguistic evolutions — can be addressed through translation, transcoding and novel design approaches.**

**In collaboration with the IISG, students will research, design and develop long-term archival approaches for a single cultural commodity. This process requires both resilient hardware and software, new digital tools and analogue strategies for transcoding media. Students in IMD and Coding will learn about current strategies and methods for archiving digital culture at the IISG. During the assignment, they will select materials from the physical archive of the IISG and also explore the hardware and tools used for transcoding and digitizing various media at the institution. The aim of this collaboration is for students to devise novel processes with existing transcoding systems at the IISG, but also develop new tools and transcoding methods that can be of interest for the IISG in thinking about how they translate between physical and digital materials.**

# **BRIEF**

**Research, design and develop a *long-term archival solution* for a single physical, cultural commodity. Your approach will make use of both hardware and software, digital tools and analogue strategies. The emphasis of this assignment is on transcoding, and a single object or material will therefore be transcoded multiple times and through different strategies and tools developed in your research process.**

## **Steps**

**Select one artefact from the physical archives of the IISG archive (for example: a Poster or Pin or Object or Book) which you will be working with to *transcode* into a number of diverse media and formats. You can make use of the transcoding equipment of the IISG, but will also develop your own additional methods. This includes digital tools, created in coding, for performing your transcodings.**

**During this project documentation of the research, process, artefact translations and transcoding tool(s) will be logged in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (a lightweight markup language). This document will function as a repository for all the work. Changes and developments will be tracked using GitHub. (Apps such as Notion & Dropbox Paper natively work with Markdown)**

**The Markdown documents of all students will be compiled into a large, collective manual on resilient archives, featuring the research, digital tools and transcoded cultural commodities developed during the semester. In building this collective set of alternative transcoding tools — and putting them in practice — the subject of resilience is central.**

## **Outcomes**

**A digital, screen-based *Collection of Archival Resilience*, featuring:**

- **The Physical Artefacts from the IISG: transcoded into diverse media (multiple transcodings for each object)**
- **A repository of your transcoding tools (including documentation & instructions)**

**The outcomes (including both analog transcodings and the digital repository of tools) will be exhibited at the IISG. Students will also present or give a reading of their processes, transcoding tools and research.**

**Your Markdown document is therefor your primary design format for all outcomes. You will submit one .md file, all media will be embedded or linked inside.**

**Notes from the research New Age, Tarot, Esotericism**

- Give a meaningful perspective of the past
- Provide some understanding of the present
- Reveal potential alternatives of the future
- Each tarot deck has and author and an illustrator
- Author makes each card with specific intent
- Intents are shown within the symbolism and the colours
- Each imagery and color has a purpose on a card
- The rider tarot deck is the most common deck
- In a deck there are
- 78 cards
- 22 cards are the major archana
- 56 are the minor (lesser) archana
- Major archana
- Card Numbers 21-1, 1 unnumbered Brad; The Fool
- There is usually a name on the bottom of each card
- Show the bigger picture and long term direction/situation you may experience
- Minor archana
- are in reference to everyday actions/situation
- 4 different suits; swards, wands, pentacles, cups
- Within each suit there are 14 cards
- Many different types of tarot readings, 2 mains kind are question readings (when you have specific questions/intentions, you want guidance on something specific), and general readings (no specific intention)
- Guidance
- Spiritual guidance
- Guided meditation
- Divination
- Shellwork
- Gateway to connect with ancestors or the supernatural
- Each card has an upright and reversed meaning — reversed card can mean that the meaning of the specific card is weakened, delayed or the complete opposite meaning
- **When it comes to Tarot, fortune-telling is out, and intuition is in, especially if you want to create your ideal future and manifest your goals.**
- The most powerful way to read the Tarot is to use the cards to access your intuition and your inner wisdom. The imagery in the cards give you instant access to your subconscious mind and your intuition. And from this place of inner power and wisdom, you can discover how to make positive changes *now* so you can manifest your goals and your dreams in the future
- There are no ‘right' or ‘wrong' meanings of the Tarot cards.
- That the Tarot originated in ancient Egypt as a divinatory tool is a romantic misconception. Ron Decker's meticulous scholarship will surprise practitioners and academics alike, revealing the Tarot's true evolution and meanings as its inventor(s) understood it.
- The Tarot consists of the Minor Arcana, four suits of cards similar to our modern deck, and the Major Arcana, twenty-two allegorical or "trump" cards. Decker says the four-suit deck was invented in Asia Minor before AD 1000; Italian courtiers added the trumps in the 1400s. But Tarot was first used as a game. Tarot divination was only created in the 1700s by a Parisian fortuneteller who based the trump images on Hermeticism, which merges Greco-Egyptian alchemy, astrology, numerology, magic, and mysticism. Today, the suit-cards are often traced to the ancient Jewish Cabala. But, says Decker, they, too, acquired their meanings only in the 1700s, and he cites a lost numerical system based on Cabala at that time
- Decker's interpretation integrates three whole systems-astrological, arithmological, mystagogical (concerning initiation rites into the Mysteries). His depth of knowledge makes the book a must-have for serious students of Tarot and esotericism
- What is the meaning of life and death?
- What is the nature of ultimate reality?
- Who are we? What are we doing in. This world?
- To be able to answer such questions through esotericism, we need to seek inner transformation within. All the answers are always personal, unlike in other religions
- Every spiritual lesson we meet in our lives can be found in the seventy-eight Tarot cards. And when we consult the Tarot, we’ll get shown the exact lessons we need to learn and master to live an inspired life. It’s like holding up a mirror to yourself so that you can access your subconscious mind and tap into the wisdom (and answers) that lives in us all.
- Tarot is perfect for self-development, making choices, manifesting goals, coaching others, planning a business, meditating—you name it. Simply ask a question, pull a card, and dive into the imagery of the card to give you instant access to your inner wisdom and the answer you need.
- Graham Hancock — Our materialist science reduces everything to matter.
- We are just meat, we are just our bodies
- When the brain is dead, that’s the end of concousness
- Our consciousness is the great mystery of our science
- Today’s society is rather disconnected from our spiritual side

The focus of this project is exploring the visual and auditory language of the new Age movement, based on my findings and research on De Kosmos meditation centre, their magazine Called the Cosmic Papers and people and events that were involved with this organisation. 

*transcoding 1 is the literary description of the covers of the issues of Cosmic Papers.*

**transcoding 1:** A woman is in industrial looking cosmic space surrounded by different types of structures, machine looking planets or aliens and mountains. The colours are light pink, dark blue and white. Her hair is pointing upwards and part of her head is made of the machine looking planets/aliens/structures. Everything seems to be connected to each other.
